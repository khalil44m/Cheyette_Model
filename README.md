# Cheyette_Model
Forward Rate Model

This repo contains a restitued work from a previous experience of implementing a Interest Forward Rate pricing model.

Cheyette model belongs to the class of continuous no-arbitrage Term Structure models (known as Heath-Jarrow-Merton Framework). O. Cheyette dealt with the non-markovian propery (path dependence) by imposing a forward rate volatility term structure.
